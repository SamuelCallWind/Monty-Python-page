# Monty-Python-page
##Welcome to my Monty Python's Round Table webpage project, a lighthearted, Monty Python-themed page to learn the basics of web development

### HTML bullets points from the project : 

Doctype, HTML, Head, and Body: The base of the HTML document structure
Meta tags, title, link to the stylesheet and to the JS file for scripts
Divs with classes or ID, images and lists (ul / li) and anchors targeting funny things in the wep theme
Audio: Used on some links in the header
Buttons,P and H1, H2 tags for adding text content to the webpage.
Strong: Used for emphasizing certain parts of the text (The names for the quotes)



### For CSS parts: 

Fonts: Imported a fancy font 'Playfair Display' from Google Fonts to make the page look a bit more medieval
Flexboxes: Used for easy alignment and spacing of the webpage elements.
Transitions and Hover Effects: Added on the button for a dynamic user interaction feel
Text and Box Shadows: Added for visual depth on certain elements



### Javascript part: 

It was rather simple as the project was more about creating the webpage than it's interaction 
There was still some small things added like:
-The generation of random quotes in the style of Monty Python's "The Holy Grail"
    and
-The sound effects applied on the click in the headers
